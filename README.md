# COVID and Online Jobs
## Project information
- **Author**: Ace Asim, Ethics and Leadership (Public Policy), Class of 2025, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Prof. Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: Submissions to the Final Project for [STATS201 Introduction to Machine Learning for Social Science, 2023 Spring Term (Seven Week - First)](https://ms.pubpub.org/) instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Acknowledgments**: Acknowledgements to Prof. Luyao Zhang and Ava Baker whom this project could not be done without.
- **Project Summary**: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an immeasurable impact on the job market, with numerous companies embracing remote work for the safety of their employees. This has led to a surge in the demand for virtual jobs, especially in industries that can be remote. This study aims to examine if there is a causal relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in virtual jobs. From analyzing the popularity of virtual jobs over time, we found the results to support the hypothesis that COVID-19 has led to a spike in the interest in virtual jobs and that this upward trend is likely to persist as corporations become more resourceful in creating online jobs. This study highlights the impact of the pandemic on the job market and the potential benefits of increased flexibility and opportunities for online work.

- *Chat GPT's Take*:

<img width="746" alt="Screen Shot 2023-03-07 at 6 25 11 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122700704/223380217-9fecb307-c34e-462d-b4ce-35552a3d249b.png">

  - **Application Scenario**: Not only is this information significant for workers and employers, but also for policymakers. From here, employers need to adopt new practices to manage and evaluate remote workers. Workers need to acquire new skills to succeed in virtual work environments. Policymakers need to adjust policies to support remote work. This study highlights the importance of resourcefulness and adaptation in the face of the unexpected (Tomić and Vizinger 2023).
  - **Methodology**: The data queried in this study is the popularity of the search term "virtual jobs" over the period of March 2018 to February 2023  to provide additional evidence of the trend. The main focus remains to identify any significant changes in the frequency of virtual job postings before and after March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit. It is hypothesized that there will be a significant increase in the frequency of virtual job postings after March 2020, and this trend will continue in the future.
  - **Results**: The results of this study provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge and increase of virtual jobs in the United States, as reflected in the increase of virtual job postings and popularity of the search term "virtual jobs" since March 2020. The upward trend has continued, implying that virtual work is here to stay. 
  - **Intellectual Merits**:
  -  *Addressing a timely and relevant topic.
  -  *Contributing to the existing literature.
  -  *Using data-driven analysis.
  -  *Highlighting potential implications and considerations for stakeholders, highlighting considerations for policymakers, employers, and workers in adapting to this new trend.

## Final reflections

As the course comes to a close, I can confidently say that I have experienced tremendous growth in various aspects of my life. Firstly, intellectually, I have gained a deep understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques, enabling me to tackle real-world problems using interdisciplinary data. Through practical applications, I have learned how to structure machine learning problems, identify relevant algorithmic tools, and evaluate performance to produce accurate and meaningful results.

Secondly, professionally, this course has equipped me with the necessary skills to thrive in the technology industry. I have expanded my knowledge of programming languages, including R and Python, and developed an interest in their intersection with ethics and law. This newfound passion has motivated me to explore how Artificial Intelligence can become a useful and safe tool for the world.

Finally, this course has encouraged me to reflect on living a purposeful life. The DKU 7 animating principles, particularly rooted in globalism and wise leadership, have played a significant role in shaping my perspective on what it means to live a purposeful life. Through collaborative problem-solving and lucid communication, I have gained a deeper appreciation for the value of working with others toward a common goal. Furthermore, as a global citizen, I feel a responsibility to use my skills to make a positive impact on society.

In conclusion, this course has been a transformative experience, providing me with the necessary skills to tackle real-world problems, grow professionally, and live a purposeful life. As I move forward in my academic and professional pursuits, I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned from the DKU community and look forward to contributing to positive change in the world. Thank you so much, STATS-201!
