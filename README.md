- **Project Summary**: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an immeasurable impact on the job market, with numerous companies embracing remote work for the safety of their employees. This has led to a surge in the demand for virtual jobs, especially in industries that can be remote. This study aims to examine if there is a causal relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in virtual jobs. From analyzing the popularity of virtual jobs over time, we found the results to support the hypothesis that COVID-19 has led to a spike in the interest in virtual jobs and that this upward trend is likely to persist as corporations become more resourceful in creating online jobs. This study highlights the impact of the pandemic on the job market and the potential benefits of increased flexibility and opportunities for online work.

  - **Application Scenario**: Not only is this information significant for workers and employers, but also for policymakers. From here, employers need to adopt new practices to manage and evaluate remote workers. Workers need to acquire new skills to succeed in virtual work environments. Policymakers need to adjust policies to support remote work. This study highlights the importance of resourcefulness and adaptation in the face of the unexpected (Tomić and Vizinger 2023).
  - **Methodology**: The data queried in this study is the popularity of the search term "virtual jobs" over the period of March 2018 to February 2023  to provide additional evidence of the trend. The main focus remains to identify any significant changes in the frequency of virtual job postings before and after March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit. It is hypothesized that there will be a significant increase in the frequency of virtual job postings after March 2020, and this trend will continue in the future.
  - **Results**: The results of this study provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge and increase of virtual jobs in the United States, as reflected in the increase of virtual job postings and popularity of the search term "virtual jobs" since March 2020. The upward trend has continued, implying that virtual work is here to stay.
